			I'm working with Ken Perlin as a Research Scientist at the <a href="https://frl.nyu.edu/">Future Reality Lab</a> at NYU, where I explore the intersection between procedural generation, machine learning and computer graphics.
			I enjoy new diverse, challenges that open my eyes to new possibilities.
			I have a broad set of interests, while focusing on computer graphics, and leveraging machine learning as a powerful tool in my research towards democratizing Future Reality.

			I recently completed my Masters in Computer Science (MSCS) at New York University - Courant Institute of Mathematics,
			focusing on machine learning and computer graphics. 
			I was a Teaching Assistant for Introduction to Programming, holding office hours and evaluating / providing feedback on weekly assignments.

			During my undergrad I studied Computer Science specializing in <i>Computer Graphics &amp; Visualization</i> and <i>Machine Intelligence</i> (B.S. in CS) at Purdue University (West Lafayette, Indiana), 
			I was a Research Assistant and later a Research Fellow at <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/discoverypark/vaccine/">VACCINE</a> where my work resulted in several <a href="/research#publications">publications</a>,
			and a Teaching Assistant for Software Engineering in the CS department (CS307). I guided and evaluated several teams of 4-6 students each semester in developing open ended semester-long projects utilizing Agile Scrum methodologies.
