			During my undergrad I studied Computer Science specializing in <i>Computer Graphics &amp; Visualization</i> (B.S. in CS) at Purdue University (West Lafayette, Indiana), 
			I was a Research Assistant and later a Research Fellow at <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/discoverypark/vaccine/">VACCINE</a> where my work resulted in several <a href="/research#publications">publications</a>,
			and a Teaching Assistant for Software Engineering in the CS department (CS307). I guided and evaluated several teams of 4-6 students each semester in developing open ended semester-long projects utilizing Agile Scrum methodologies.
